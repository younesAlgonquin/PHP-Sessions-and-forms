# PHP-Sessions-and-forms

This program creates a PHP script that performs the following tasks:

   Divide the content area of this page into two sections (Side by Side) 
   On the left side: creates a form that accepts the user's information: 
                 (First and last name, Telephone Number, email, birth day, profession (Radio button), favorite sport (select box))
   When the user clicks ‘Submit’, it gathers all the information from the form on the left side and display the results on the right side.
